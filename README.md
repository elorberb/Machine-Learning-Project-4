# Machine-Learning-Project-4
Using Linear, Ensemble and Deep Learning models for classification task.
In this project we recieved data on patients in clinics to predict whether a patient will die of a heart attack or not.
We used models of three types.
Linear model - Logistic Regression.
Ensemble model - Adaboost.
Deep learning model - Neural Network (ANN).
We processed the data to work with them in the most accurate way and tested the results of the various models by metrics such as recall, accuracy, AUC score and more.
In order to find the best parameters for the models, we performed a grid search for each model.
